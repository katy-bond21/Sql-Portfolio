# Sql-Portfolio
This repository contains examples of SQL I've written for personal projects and coursework using SQL.

Below are a few highlighted projects, including data visualisations I created using Tableau Public. Feel free to take a look and [reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katy-b-3a0147282/) if you have any feedback or questions.

## Highlighted Projects

* **Green Cycles SQL Analytics** - [SQL](https://github.com/katy-bond21/Sql-Portfolio/blob/main/Predicting%20Book%20Ratings): This SQL project explores various aspects of film data using pgAdmin for PostgreSQL. It covers diverse queries, including analysing replacement costs, categorising films based on cost ranges, filtering films by category and length, investigating actor appearances, identifying unassociated addresses, and examining sales and revenue patterns. The project provides a comprehensive view of the dataset, extracting valuable insights related to film categories, customer behavior, staff performance, and financial metrics.
  
* **Employee Management and Analysis for Green Cycles** - [SQL](https://github.com/katy-bond21/Sql-Portfolio/blob/main/Employee%20Management%20and%20Analysis%20for%20Green%20Cycles): This SQL project involves the creation and manipulation of tables for a dataset named "Green Cycles" sourced from Nikolai Schuler, queried using pgAdmin for PostgreSQL. The tasks include defining tables for employees and departments, altering table structures, inserting data, and performing various updates and queries. Notable tasks include creating a view for employee information, calculating average salaries for positions and divisions, creating a ranking based on salary within departments, and finding the highest-paid employees within their respective positions and departments.

### Is South Africa on the Brink of Darkness? - [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/katy.bond/viz/IsSouthAfricaontheBrinkofDarkness/IsSouthAfricaontheBrinkofDarkness3)
- **Data:** [Eskom Data Portal](https://www.eskom.co.za/dataportal/)
- **Audience:** Anyone interested in the energy crisis in South Africa
- **Purpose:** To raise awareness of the severe energy crisis in South Africa using data from Eskom (the national energy provider) from the last 5 years

In this viz, I used data from Eskom containing data relating to their energy operations from 2019 to 2023.  The purpose is to draw attention to the severity of the situation, prompting a critical examination of the factors contributing to the crisis.

### Going up in Smoke: are we wasting the London Fire Brigade's time? - [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/katy.bond/viz/KatyBond-LFBDraft41/GoingupinSmoke)
- **Data:** [London Fire Brigade Incident Records](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/london-fire-brigade-incident-records)
- **Audience:** For those intrigued by the allocation of resources within the London Fire Brigade
- **Purpose:** To understand which incidents recieve the biggest proportion of resources

This viz provides an overview of the London Fire Brigade's resource allocation in responding to incidents between 2020 and 2023. It breaks down incident types, revealing their frequency and distribution, while also pinpointing the areas where the most resources are deployed. The purpose is to raise awareness of the biggest alloctaion of resources and possible solutions.
